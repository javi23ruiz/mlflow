# MLFLOW

MLOps have become a key part of the data science ecosystem. Developing models is noy about training (model.fit()) and predicting (model.predict()), it involves monitoring the perfformance of the models. The goal of this repository is to play around with MLFlowÂ´s capabilities. MLFlow is an open source library for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. In the notebooks of this repo we are gonna use the MLFlow Python API to log metrics, parameters and artifacts related to the models that we are going to train. MLFlow provides a UI to visualize all the experiments that have been carried out 

**MLFlow_basics.ipynb**: This notebook provides an introduction of MLFlow, the different parts and how to log and visualize metrics of a trained model.
